Microbit: My robot asks me for money 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jskg6gfSGd8

![Image](related1.png)

I found this video while researching for Assessment 1 and it was a huge inspiration for my project. It's a robot with a simple function made possible by the micro:bit. A small detail I liked was the sound of the coin container slapping back on the table after storing the coins - it unintentially gives the robot character. 

### Related project 2 ###
Micro:bit milk jar robot

Similarly to the first related project, it's another cute robot friend. Seeing this project made me consider putting movement in my project, but it did definitely give me ideas on how to give my coin bank some personality. Maybe incorporate some movement?

### Related project 3 ###
Interactive Animal Coin Bank

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ--GDy52ns

![Image](related3.png)

A popular interactive toy that has a simple sensor to detect the weight of the coin, and then a character that grabs the coin. Video attached shows the mechanisms inside. This relates to my porject in terms of an event happening after the coin is inserted/placed in. 

### Related project 4 ###
Fish Bank

An interactive coin bank by Moose toys. I don't think this product was a huge success but it caught my eye when I was young. When a coin is inserted, a sequence of animation appears on the screen. Counts the money inserted in the bank and has various other interactive options.

An interactive coin bank toy by Fisher Price. Has a sensor as it counts the coins and has other features such as music, silly sounds and phrases. Related to my project by it's function. 


## Other research ##
I've had a look into what I could use to implement the motion sensing for this project. I have a ultrasonic sensor lying around but I don't think that'll do the job. After some research into other projects I found a Arduino Compatible PIR Motion Detector Module (https://www.jaycar.com.au/arduino-compatible-pir-motion-detector-module/p/XC4444), but after having spoken to a Jaycar Representative they've let me know that I'd need a T-Adaptor shield. Because of self isolating as well, I've decided against this and I had the idea of implementing a similar design inspired by my timing gates project. By using cardboard and aluminium foil to detect the movement of the coin as it enters through the slot, I can get the micro:bit to play a sequence of tunes when this event occurs (happy tune). After five seconds if another coin isn't inserted again it goes to play the angry tune (see interaction flowchart).
EDIT: After deliberation I have decided to use the PIR motion sensor, as the T-Adaptor isn't actually necessary. Jaycar was wrong!

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->
A device that displays emotion until a certain action is complete.
### Design ideation ###

EDIT: Final Concept 2.0

Exterior looks the same but the interior is redone to make more sense and function.

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material. --->

I began by figuring out what I wanted my coin bank to do, which were:
1. Turn on/off with an external button.
2. Detect the coin going into the bank.
3. Play sound. 

The easiest to install was the Piezo Buzzer to play sound as it's something I've done previously with other micro:bit experiments. It was quite straightforward. I put in some basic coding to make sure it worked.

At this stage it plays the opening tune when turned on and then the angry tune after 5000 m/s. 

I then cleared this code and removed the buzzers to test the PIR motion detector using the following code: 

![Image](code2.png)

And yay!! No issues. Then I cleared that and worked on the external on/off button. I originally bought a pushbutton switch with a latching bottom (I think is what they're called? https://www.jaycar.com.au/spst-pushbutton-black-actuator-latching/p/SP0718) but found it much more easier to install a bigger push switch that can be connected to a breadboard. This button is attached to a separate breadboard from the piezo buzzer board.

So I had to make some adjustments here, As I had to stick this breadboard up to the roof of the coin box with the button peaking out, I couldn't have one of my typical jumper cables with the black tip as it would block the button from being pressed. I ended up using a different wiring, and then connecting that end of the wiring to the jumper cables that I usually used.

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.
