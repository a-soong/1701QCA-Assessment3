<!--- PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case. This should be suitable for a catalog, poster, or other display material about the project. --->

The Nagbot 3000 is a coin bank made to yell at those who need to save more loose change. He plays a happy melody when a coin is inserted, and mumbles an awful noise when he's hungry for more coins!
